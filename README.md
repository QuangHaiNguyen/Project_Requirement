# Project Management Sheet

## Motivation

when I am working on a private project, there are many problems I have to face. First of all, if the project is interupted
for a while, when I restart it again, I dont know where to pick it up.  

I also have the problem with hardware and cost management. I dont know which hardware I am using and how much money I have spent on the project.

The next obvious thing is, there is no tool to manage requirements, architecture and any other documentation or resources.

One last thing I want to add is I have never track how much time I spend on a project.

## Solution

to cope with the mentioned proplems, I want to create an excel sheet with macros function. The excel sheet must address those problems with the following solution

* Project journal where I can shortly describe what I have done and when I have done that thing

* List for tracking which hardware is used for the project, how much money have spent on the project regarding the development, prototype phase and the Bill of Material if the project is realized into a complete product.

* An interface to add, delete, modify requirements. It also allows user to trace the requirements to the supported requirements and other design artifacts (UML diagram, resources)

## Requirement of this project

Since there is no requirement tool for tracking the requirements of this project, I am using simply the the README file to store the requiremet.

Requirement List:

1. [] The Project Management Workbook shall include Five Excel Sheets: Project Journal, Cost Tracking, Bill of Material, Requirements, Project Time Management.

2.
